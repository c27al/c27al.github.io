9/22: Today we linked github to our folders in the terminal app. I worked on adding more divs to my index page and linking them to my journal page and projects page.
</p>
<p>
9/27: Today in class we worked on adding one new thing to our website. I made it so that when you hover over one of my divs it turns into a gif. 
</p>
<p>
	9/29: Today we learned how to publish our changes to our websites onto the internet. Here is how to add things to my online version of my website:
	<ol>
		<li>open my terminal and navigate to my folder by typing cd ./desktop/c27al.github.io c</li>
		<li> if i want to see if i added anything i can type <u>"git status"</u> and it can show me my changes!</li>
		<li> to add what i made i type git add .</li>
		<li> then i commit my changes and this means adding a little note that marks what i did, so i say git commit -m "whatever i did" </li>
		<li> to finish it off and put my changes online i type git push</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		10/4: Today I finalized the first version of my website! I changed the positioning of each div a little bit and added a butterfly on the left side of the home page. I also added a little link on the journal and projects page to go back to the home page.
	</p>
	<p>
		10/6: Today we worked on our animations, and I added a picture in mine and changed the length of the animation. I also linked my first project to my projects page. Finally, I added a song on my home page, but I want to try and add the autoplay feature, but it isn't working right now.
	</p>
	<p>10/25: Today I started my jumpscare project. I think I am going to make something with a car driving someplace, and when it gets there on the screen a scary image will pop up.
	</p>
	<p>
		10/29: Today, I finalized my jumpscare project. There are two jumpscares: one is a scary image that pops up after you click on an island on the screen, and the other jumpscare is music of someone screaming after you click on the screen. I added an event listener for clicking, and made it have the photo pop up and the music play. I made the heading of the code "click on the car's final destination" to get the user to click on the island, triggering the event listener. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		10/30: Today, I watched a video about event listeners and I came up with a question which we will go over in class on Wednesday: 
		How many different event listeners are there?
	</p>
	<p>
		11/8: Today we learned how to create a div over and over in a custom amount of seconds. We also learned how to use a function to create divs instead of having to do it manually such as height, length, background image, etc. 
	</p>
	<p>
		11/10: Today we learned more about how to create functions. 
	</p>
	<p> 11/20: Today, I made a gratitude card for  my parents. When you click a random key on your keyboard, it shows things I am grateful for. I linked it to my projects page and I'm excited to show it to my parents!
	</p>
	<p>
		11/30: Today for homework, we needed to come up with four questions relating to anything that we have done this year. Here are the four questions I came up with:
	<p>
		1. What does each part of stating an event listener mean?
	</p><p>
		2. Why do we do some things in css and some things in javascript?
	</p><p>
		3. Since we do css and javascript on the same document, can you do other languages on the same document?
	</p><p>
		4. Why does the x and y plane for positioning divs start on the corner, why isn’t the origin in the middle?</p>
