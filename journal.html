9/22: Today we linked github to our folders in the terminal app. I worked on adding more divs to my index page and linking them to my journal page and projects page.
</p>
<p>
9/27: Today in class we worked on adding one new thing to our website. I made it so that when you hover over one of my divs it turns into a gif. 
</p>
<p>
	9/29: Today we learned how to publish our changes to our websites onto the internet. Here is how to add things to my online version of my website:
	<ol>
		<li>open my terminal and navigate to my folder by typing cd ./desktop/c27al.github.io c</li>
		<li> if i want to see if i added anything i can type <u>"git status"</u> and it can show me my changes!</li>
		<li> to add what i made i type git add .</li>
		<li> then i commit my changes and this means adding a little note that marks what i did, so i say git commit -m "whatever i did" </li>
		<li> to finish it off and put my changes online i type git push</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		10/4: Today I finalized the first version of my website! I changed the positioning of each div a little bit and added a butterfly on the left side of the home page. I also added a little link on the journal and projects page to go back to the home page.
	</p>
	<p>
		10/6: Today we worked on our animations, and I added a picture in mine and changed the length of the animation. I also linked my first project to my projects page. Finally, I added a song on my home page, but I want to try and add the autoplay feature, but it isn't working right now.
	</p>
	<p>10/25: Today I started my jumpscare project. I think I am going to make something with a car driving someplace, and when it gets there on the screen a scary image will pop up.
	</p>
	<p>
		10/29: Today, I finalized my jumpscare project. There are two jumpscares: one is a scary image that pops up after you click on an island on the screen, and the other jumpscare is music of someone screaming after you click on the screen. I added an event listener for clicking, and made it have the photo pop up and the music play. I made the heading of the code "click on the car's final destination" to get the user to click on the island, triggering the event listener. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		10/30: Today, I watched a video about event listeners and I came up with a question which we will go over in class on Wednesday: 
		How many different event listeners are there?
	</p>
	<p>
		11/8: Today we learned how to create a div over and over in a custom amount of seconds. We also learned how to use a function to create divs instead of having to do it manually such as height, length, background image, etc. 
	</p>
	<p>
		11/10: Today we learned more about how to create functions. 
	</p>
	<p> 11/20: Today, I made a gratitude card for  my parents. When you click a random key on your keyboard, it shows things I am grateful for. I linked it to my projects page and I'm excited to show it to my parents!
	</p>
	<p>
		11/30: Today for homework, we needed to come up with four questions relating to anything that we have done this year. Here are the four questions I came up with:
	<p>
		1. What does each part of stating an event listener mean?
	</p><p>
		2. Why do we do some things in css and some things in javascript?
	</p><p>
		3. Since we do css and javascript on the same document, can you do other languages on the same document?
	</p><p>
		4. Why does the x and y plane for positioning divs start on the corner, why isn’t the origin in the middle?</p>
	<p>
		12/1: Today we learned about for loops. This makes it so that the div will paste the amount of times that I tell it to. I did mine on how many minutes phone usage I do a day, and each phone is one minute.
	</p>
	<p>
		12/15: Today we finished up our function codes. Mine is a bowl and you can choose what pasta noodle, sauce, and toppings you want. The way it works is there is an event listener for the bowl and when you click it creates a div automatically, so when you click any of the pictures of the toppings it stores it as a variable and then when you click the bowl, the event listener is triggered and it shows the stored div wherever you click. To do that part, I did event client X and Y.
	</p>
	<p>
		1/10: Today was the first class back from break! We are learning how to randomize arrays in pictures. I am going to do a dinner decider because I never know what I want for dinner. It is going to be so that when you click a random dinner choice appears. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		1/12: Today I decided to redo my entire website! I changed it from Olivia Rodrigo themed to more of a navy beachy theme. I like this one a lot better so I'm glad I changed it.
	</p>
	<p>
		1/19: Today I finished my array! It's a dinner decider. I used an array and an event listener for clicking to randomize a photo on the screen. Molly helped me make a little box so that when I click the food only appears in the box, and not the entire screen. I also used the Math Random code to randomize what photo appears on the screen. 
	</p>
	<p>
		2/14: Today we learned how to make input boxes. I also finished my reveal.js slideshow and some people presented them to the class. I made my slideshow about reasons I love camp, and there is a photo in the background that stays absolute when the reason I love that place shows up. 
	</p>
	<p>
		2/16: Today I added a bunch of projects to my projects page. First, my cat project. I made an event listener for different pressed arrow keys. Then, I made a div of my cat, and you can move him around the screen by pressing different arrow keys. Finally, my valentines project. My table that I sit with in class made valentines for each other, and I made one for Alexa. I added an event listener for hover, and there are a bunch of divs of valentines themed pictures, and when you hover over each one, it changes into different pictures of us.
	</p>
	<p>
		2/21: Today we learned about rgba. We made projects where the color of the screen corresponds with the placement of the mouse. We learned about event listeners that relate to clientX and clientY of the mouse
	</p>
	<p>
		2/28: Today we were given class time to work on our projects to polish them up, or work on our projects page. I chose to work on my input project, and I made it a guess my favorite color project. I added an input box, and an if/else statement. If the color inputted is wrong, it says "[color inputted] is wrong, try again." If the color inputted is correct, it says "Good job! You got it."</p>
	<p>
		5/17: Sorry I haven't done a journal entry in so long! Let me get you all caught up. In march, we started to brainstorm ideas of what to do for our final projects of the year. Since I like cooking, I decided to do a project with my friend Amanda where we make a website that sort of resembles a "cookbook." In this cookbook, there are different types of recipes, which link to the recipe itself, a picture of our final product, our ratings, and what we could've done better. We initially started on a website called glitch, because we were able to share the project with each other. This allowed us to work on the project together over most of the time we worked on the project itself. We created a bunch of different pages for each recipe. </p>
		<p>
		After we finished creating the templates for each recipe page, we went on Canva and started to create the "recipe books" themselves. We actually AI generated a pink cookbook that was just blank inside. We added text to all the pages of the cookbook, making a new page for every recipe. When we finished with that, we started to transfer all the glitch pages into Sublime Text so that we could link it to our projects page. This part was a little difficult for us because we were no longer able to work on the same document since Sublime Text doesn't allow you to share with others. 
	</p>
	<p>An issue we ran into was that on Glitch, whenever we tried to import a div, they would make the quality a lot lower than it was so the div would appear blurry. The way we solved this is we just put a blue background in place of the div, and we are going to now add the actual div into the Sublime Text version of our project. We still have to work on our slideshow, but we have an idea for it; we are going to make a story about us as little children who wanted to learn how to cook and they find a cookbook from their future selves, and then it will link to our final project. We start presentations at the end of next week, so Amanda and I are going to work on it a lot over the weekend. 
	</p>
	<p>
		5/22: Today we presented our final project! I am so happy that it turned out the way we wanted it to and I'm also proud of our progress in comp sci this year and in the kitchen.</p>
