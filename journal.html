9/22: Today we linked github to our folders in the terminal app. I worked on adding more divs to my index page and linking them to my journal page and projects page.
</p>
<p>
9/27: Today in class we worked on adding one new thing to our website. I made it so that when you hover over one of my divs it turns into a gif. 
</p>
<p>
	9/29: Today we learned how to publish our changes to our websites onto the internet. Here is how to add things to my online version of my website:
	<ol>
		<li>open my terminal and navigate to my folder by typing cd ./desktop/c27al.github.io</li>
		<li> if i want to see if i added anything i can type <u>"git status"</u> and it can show me my changes!</li>
		<li> to add what i made i type git add .</li>
		<li> then i commit my changes and this means adding a little note that marks what i did, so i say git commit -m "whatever i did" </li>
		<li> to finish it off and put my changes online i type git push</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		10/4: Today I finalized the first version of my website! I changed the positioning of each div a little bit and added a butterfly on the left side of the home page. I also added a little link on the journal and projects page to go back to the home page.
	</p>
	<p>
		10/6: Today we worked on our animations, and I added a picture in mine and changed the length of the animation. I also linked my first project to my projects page. Finally, I added a song on my home page, but I want to try and add the autoplay feature, but it isn't working right now.
