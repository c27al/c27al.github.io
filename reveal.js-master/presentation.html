						<h2>Why I love the quad</h2>
						<p>The quad is the center of camp. It is where the dining hall, the gazebo, a huge grassy field, and you can basically get anywhere from it.</p>

						<h2>Why I love waterfront</h2>
						<p>Waterfront is the place everyone wants to be when it's hot out. There's 2 bays, 2 towers, and the beach where you can tan, play volleyball, or just talk with your friends. The waterfront is one of my personal favorites. There is also a part called "senior waterfront," which features obstacle courses that we can go on.</p>

						<h2>Why I love pontooning</h2>
						<p>Pontooning makes the perfect afternoon schedule, or Evening Activity. We usually take 2 pontoons, and we go out to the main lake where we can jump in and swim around. We also take our cameras so we can take pictures together. If you go during the evening, sometimes you will get to watch the sunset which is a super fun experience to have with all your friends.</p>

						<h2>Why I love beach days</h2>
						<p>This year's beach day was one of the best days of camp. We rode there in vans, and then we got to spend the entire day at the beach. We went in the water, walked along the beach, and just talked all day. We also got to go on the boardwalk where we got ice cream and all had lunch together at a restaurant with just us, no counselors.</p>

						<h2>Why I love green and white</h2>
						<p>Green and white is the most competitive 5 days of the summer. The entire camp is split into two teams (green and white) and we just compete for 5 days in different sports. There is also tug of war, track meet, swim meet, song night, talent show, and crackery. Green and white is super fun because of all the spirit and competitiveness there is in the air. </p>

						<h2>Why I love the 4th of july</h2>
						<p>4th of july at camp is super fun. First, the scribes (the oldest group) come into your bunk and wake you up early. They are all wearing 4th of july attire, and they have airhorns and silly string that they spray on you. Everyone dresses up in red, white, and blue, and all the meals are 4th of july themed. There is also waterslides and carnival games.</p>

						<h2>Why I love campfire</h2>
						<p>Although a little boring sometimes, campfire is a place where all the girls groups come together and are led in a campfire by the oldest group. They sometimes teach cheers, or traditions about camp. We get to go to waterfront, which is so nice because we get to sit on the beach and watch the sun set.</p>

						<h2>Why I love our bunk</h2>
						<p>Our bunk is a place I love because we live there all summer. Everyone decorates their area as they like and it's so fun to live with all my friends for 7 weeks.</p>
